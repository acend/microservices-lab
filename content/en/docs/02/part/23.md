## Code Structure

The application in this lab is structured as follows:

* `docker`: contains the docker-compose specification and configuration files for our runtime environment
* `requests`: contains sample
* `monolith-application`: any code or artifact belonging to the `monolith-application` container
* `monolith-application/src/main/docker`: contains Dockerfiles to build the java application and the docker container
* `monolith-application/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/monolith/`: directory where the application code resides
* `monolith-application/src/main/resources/db`: contains the database migration scripts

Inside the `monolith-application/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/monolith/` we structure the code by the domains and the
subfolders `boundary`, `control` and `entity`. Beside domains there are also helpers like `monkey` which contains a basic
ChaosMonkey to inject errors or the package `exception` holding exceptions.


### Domains

In the application we have the following domains:

* `article`: Static Article management
* `order`: Handles the management of the order and initiates the stock management
* `stock`: Represents a Stock management and handles the amount of items in stock

The most important items in the application are:

* `order/boundary/ShopOrderResource`: Provides the REST Endpoint for creating a new order
* `order/boundary/ShopOrderService`: Handles the effective creation of the order and triggers the stock management
* `stock/boundary/ArticleStockService`: Handles the effective management of the items in stock


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Inspecting application structure

* Open the solution repo {{% param "solution_git_repo" %}}/tree/main/{{% param "folder_monolith" %}}/monolith-application and get familiar
with the Application structure.
