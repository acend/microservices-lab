## Code Structure

The application in this lab is structured as follows:

* `monolith-application`: Base directory for code or artifacts belonging to the `application` container
* `monolith-application/src/main/docker`: Dockerfiles to build application and container
* `monolith-application/src/main/java/ch/puzzle/mm/monolith/`: Location where most of the java application code resides
* `monolith-application/src/main/resources/db`: contains the database migration scripts

The java code is structured by domains and the sub folders `boundary`, `control` and `entity`. Beside domains there are
also helpers. For example the package `monkey` which contains a basic ChaosMonkey to inject errors.


### Domains

In the application we have the following domains:

* `article`: Static article management
* `order`: Handles the management of the order and initiates the stock management
* `stock`: Represents a stock management and handles the amount of items in stock

The most important classes in the application are:

* `order/boundary/ShopOrderResource.java`: Provides the RESTful API endpoint for creating a new order
* `order/boundary/ShopOrderService.java`: Handles the effective creation of the order and triggers the stock management
* `stock/boundary/ArticleStockService.java`: Handles the effective management of the items in stock


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Inspecting application structure

* Have a look at the `{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}{{% param "folder_monolith" %}}` folder and get familiar with the application structure.
