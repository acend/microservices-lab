## Available Endpoints

Endpoint                             |    Monolith    | Description
-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------
http://localhost:8080/shop-orders    | Application  | Return and create new orders
http://localhost:8080/article-stocks | Application  | List article stock count

In the source folder `<PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}{{% param "folder_monolith" %}}/requests` is an IntelliJ compatible
HTTP Request file. You may run requests directly from IntelliJ or use it as reference for your requests.


## Order state

The order is expected to have the following states

State         | Description
--------------|-------------------
COMPLETE      | Order  | Order is created and all articles were instock and the stock count have completely been decreased.
INCOMPLETE    | Stock  | Order is created but at least one article is out of stock.


## Sample Requests

Get ArticleStock information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/article-stocks
```

Get Order information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders
```

Request new order
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "articleOrders" : [
        {
            "articleId" : 1,
            "amount" : 1
        }
    ]
}'
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Testing scenario

Run the following queries:

* Check the article-stock count
* Order articleId 1
* Check orders and article-stock count again

Is the stock-count correct?
What happens if you are running out of stock?


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Injecting an error

Let us inject an error at the end of the `createShopOrder` method of the `order` microservice.

Use the chaos-monkey rest endpoint to inject an error with the following request:
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost8080/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
    {
        "clazzName": "ShopOrderResource",
        "methodName": "createShopOrder",
        "enabled": true,
        "throwException": true
  }
]'
```

This will force the method `createShopOrder` in `ShopOrderResource` to throw InternalServerError at the end of the execution.

Issue the request from the previous lab.

* Is there any difference?
* Is the data still consistent between stock and order microservice?
* Can you imagine why any inconsistency may happen?
