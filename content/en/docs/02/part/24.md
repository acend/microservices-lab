## Available Endpoints

Endpoint                             |    Monolith    | Description
-------------------------------------|--------------------|--------------------------------
http://localhost:8080/shop-orders    | Application  | Return and create new orders
http://localhost:8080/article-stocks | Application  | List article stock count
http://localhost:8080/chaos-monkey   | Application  | Lets you enable a ChaosMonkey

In the source folder `<PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}{{% param "folder_monolith" %}}/requests` is an IntelliJ compatible
HTTP Request file. You may run requests directly from IntelliJ or use it as reference for your requests.


## Order state

The order is expected to have the following states

State         | Description
--------------|-------------------
COMPLETE      | Order created and all articles were instock and the stock count have completely been decreased.
INCOMPLETE    | Order created but at least one article is out of stock.


## ChaosMonkey

There is a basic implementation of a ChaosMonkey. It will let you inject errors to methods
annotated with `@ChaosMonkey`. You may configure the ChaosMonkey using the provided RESTful API `/chaos-monkey`.

The following error types are available:

Error Type  |    Executed    | Description
------------|----------------|--------------------------------------------
RateLimit   | Before method  | Rate limit in calls/sec. Default: `Long.MAX_VALUE`
Latency     | After method   | Issues a Thread.sleep() in ms. Default: 0
ErrorRate   | After method   | Lets you specify a percentage of Errors thrown (0 to 1). Default: 0
Exception   | After method   | Always triggers an exception if enabled. Default: `false`

Sample request for configuring the chaos-monkey
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "clazzName": "ArticleStockService",
    "methodName": "orderArticles",
    "enabled": true,
    "throwException": true
  }
]'
```


## Sample Requests

Get the article stock information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/article-stocks
```

Get order information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders
```

Create new order
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "articleOrders" : [
        {
            "articleId" : 1,
            "amount" : 1
        }
    ]
}'
```


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Testing scenario

Run the following queries:

* Check the article-stock count
* Order articleId 1
* Check orders and article-stock count again

Is the stock-count correct?
What happens if you are running out of stock?


## Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Injecting an error

Enable a chaos-monkey for the method `orderArticles` in the `ArticleStockService`.
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8080/chaos-monkey \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '[
  {
    "clazzName": "ArticleStockService",
    "methodName": "orderArticles",
    "enabled": true,
    "throwException": true
  }
]'
```
This will throw an Exception after execution of the method.

* Ask yourself what to expect if an exception is thrown?

Issue the request from the previous lab.

* What did you observe? Is there any difference?
* Is the data still consistent?
* How do transactions come in play?
