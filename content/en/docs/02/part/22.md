## Docker Compose

Our setup for the application is quite simple. It consists of the Quarkus service `application` and its database
`application-db`. Further we have three more containers setup. We use `jaeger` as our tracing, `prometheus` to scrape the
metrics and `grafana` to visualize them in dashboards.

All configuration for the docker environment is located in the folder `docker`. The folder `docker/config` is used to
configure `prometheus` and `grafana`.


### Host mapped container ports

Starting up the docker-compose will create a bridge network. We mapped most container ports to the docker host.
This provides easy access for debugging like attaching the database to your IDE.

However, the most important ports of the containers are:

Container        | Internal Port   | Host Port     | Purpose
-----------------|-----------------|---------------|----------
`application`    | 8080            | 8080          | Main application port
`application-db` | 5432            | 5432          | Database port
`jaeger`         | 16686           | 16686         | Jaeger UI
`jaeger`         | 14268           | 14268         | Port used to send traces from our Quarkus applications to Jaeger
`prometheus`     | 9090            | 9090          | Prometheus service port (includes UI)
`grafana`        | 3000            | 3000          | Grafana UI

Have a look at [Jaeger Port Details](https://www.jaegertracing.io/docs/1.24/getting-started/) if you need more information
about the available Jaeger ports.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Inspecting the docker environment

* Have a look at the `docker` folder and get familiar with the docker environment specified in `docker-compose.yaml`
