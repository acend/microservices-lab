## Introduction

In the previous lab we inspected the monolithic application. In this lab we will distribute the monolith in two independent microservices.

Both microservices will use RESTful APIs to communicate with each other. We build the `order` microservice and see why data consistency
could be violated.

In a last step we will have a look at the MicroProfile Long Running Actions (LRA)[^1] and how this could help for data consistency.
At the end we will see how a SAGA orchestration approach could be built using LRA.


## Splitting the Monolith

We will split our monolith in the two contexts `order` and `stock`. The `order` microservice will manage the orders. The `stock` microservice will manage the article stock and will decrement the available stock if there is a new order.

We expect the stock count of an article to be consistent with its order count.

Can you imagine another context which exists in the monolith?

Think of a rich article catalog with pictures, thumbnails and a detailed description. There is a high chance that this would be managed in another independent microservice.

## Lab Overview

In the first version we will use the two microservice `order` and `stock`.

In a second version we will introduce the `lra-coordinator` and our environment will look like this.
