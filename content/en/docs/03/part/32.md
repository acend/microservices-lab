  Setting up your local docker environment for this lab.

{{% alert title="Environment Setup" color="warning" %}} With completing this section the environment is configured. However,
in the next few steps we will build the `order` microservice and its container. After this section you will not be able
to start the environment as this container is still missing. You will be able to start it later. {{% /alert %}}


## Changes to the docker-compose file

To split the monolith in two microservices we need to change our `docker-compose.yaml` file.

### Microservice container specification

First we deleted the `application` and `application-db` specification which belonged to our monolith. Then we created a specification for the two microservices 
`order` and `stock`. As we are building the `order` service by ourselves we reference a local container image. The `stock` service uses a pre-built image from the `quay.io/acend` registry.

```yaml
  order:
    image: {{% param "image_prefix" %}}rest-order:latest
    hostname: order
    container_name: rest-order
    ports:
      - 8080:8080
    networks:
      - rest
    depends_on:
      - order-db
    environment:
      - QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8080
      - QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:tracing:postgresql://order-db:5432/admin
      - APPLICATION_ARTICLESTOCK_API_URL=http://stock:8080/

  stock:
    image: {{%param "training_docker_repo" %}}/{{% param "image_prefix" %}}rest-stock:latest
    hostname: stock
    container_name: rest-stock
    ports:
      - 8081:8080
    networks:
      - rest
    depends_on:
      - stock-db
    environment:
      - QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8080
      - QUARKUS_DATASOURCE_JDBC_URL=jdbc:tracing:postgresql://stock-db:5432/admin
```

As both microservices need their own postgres database we added two databases to our `docker-compose.yaml`.

```yaml
  order-db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:13
    hostname: order-db
    container_name: rest-order-db
    volumes:
      - order-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    networks:
      - rest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=admin
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234
    ports:
      - 5432:5432

  stock-db:
    image: docker.io/postgres:13
    hostname: stock-db
    container_name: rest-stock-db
    volumes:
      - stock-db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data/
    networks:
      - rest
    environment:
      - POSTGRES_USER=admin
      - POSTGRES_PASSWORD=1234
    ports:
      - 5433:5432
```


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Inspecting the docker environment

Have a look at the `{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}{{% param "folder_rest" %}}/docker` folder and get familiar with the docker environment specified in `docker-compose.yaml`.
