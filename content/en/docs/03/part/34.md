  Understand how we can provide data consistency over multiple microservices.
---

Both our microservices use local transactions to store their data. There are several cases where data may get out of sync between
order and stock microservice.


## Problem

Think of the following scenario.

* New order is requested using the RESTful API
  * Order microservice will start to create new order
  * Order microservice will delegate the stock change to the stock microservice
  * Order microservice fails for any reason
  
![Monolith Split](../../data-inconsistency.png)

This results in a stock microservice where the stock has already been decreased. The order however failed to be persisted.


## Microprofile LRA

{{% alert title="Motivation" color="primary" %}} The proposal introduces annotations and APIs for services to coordinate
long running activities whilst still maintaining loose coupling and doing so in such a way as to guarantee a globally
consistent outcome without the need to take locks on data. [...]

Traditional techniques for guaranteeing consistency in distributed environments has focused on XA transactions where
locks may be held for long periods thereby introducing strong coupling between services and decreasing concurrency to
unacceptable levels. Additionally, if such a transaction aborts then valuable work which may be valid will be rolled back.
In view of these issues an alternative approach is desirable. - [github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/microprofile-lra-spec.adoc) {{% /alert %}}

LRA Protocol Sequence - source: [github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra](https://github.com/eclipse/microprofile-lra/blob/master/spec/src/main/asciidoc/images/lra.png)
![LRA Sequence](../../lra-sequence.png)

LRA is built for microservices with RESTful communication. Using LRA each microservice participating in a LRA will have
to provide a compensate action which will be invoked if the transaction is cancelled. The life cycle of LRAs can be
managed by annotating the JAX-RS resources with the following annotations.

   Annotation   |   Description
----------------|----------------------
`@LRA`          | Controls the life cycle of an LRA.
`@Compensate`   | Indicates that the method should be invoked if the LRA is cancelled.
`@Complete`     | Indicates that the method should be invoked if the LRA is closed.
`@Forget`       | Indicates that the method may release any resources that were allocated for this LRA.
`@Leave`        | Indicates that this class is no longer interested in this LRA.
`@Status`       | When the annotated method is invoked it should report the status.
`@AfterLRA`     | When an LRA has reached a final state the annotated method is invoked.

See the sample below how an implementation could look like.
```java
@Path("/")
@ApplicationScoped
public class SimpleLRAParticipant {
    @LRA(LRA.Type.REQUIRES_NEW)
    @Path("/cdi")
    @PUT
    public void doInTransaction(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
        /*
         * Perform business actions in the context of the LRA identified by the
         * value in the injected JAX-RS header. This LRA was started just before
         * the method was entered (REQUIRES_NEW) and will be closed when the
         * method finishes at which point the completeWork method below will be
         * invoked.
         */
    }

    @Complete
    @Path("/complete")
    @PUT
    public Response completeWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
        /*
         * Free up resources allocated in the context of the LRA identified by the
         * value in the injected JAX-RS header.
         *
         * Since there is no @Status method in this class, completeWork MUST be
         * idempotent and MUST return the status.
         */
         return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Completed.name()).build();
    }

    @Compensate
    @Path("/compensate")
    @PUT
    public Response compensateWork(@HeaderParam(LRA_HTTP_CONTEXT_HEADER) URI lraId) {
        /*
         * The LRA identified by the value in the injected JAX-RS header was
         * cancelled so the business logic should compensate for any actions
         * that have been performed while running in its context.
         *
         * Since there is no @Status method in this class, compensateWork MUST be
         * idempotent and MUST return the status
         */
         return Response.ok(ParticipantStatus.Compensated.name()).build();
    }
}
```

## Providing Compensation

What does providing a compensation mean to our microservices?

Each operation like order creation and stock reservation is run in a LRA context. The LRA context is reflected by an
associated lra Id. The `lraId` will be injected in the REST-Request headers. The call for compensation will also contain
this id. This means that we must be able to revert our database changes by using this lra id whenever a REST call is
made to the method annotated with `@Compensate`.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - How to track LRAs

Think of compensating an order, which changes are necessary to our entities that we can revert the change later on?

{{% details title="Sample Solution" %}}
Lets assume the LRA with id `lra-1` needs to be compensated.

To compensate the database changes we need to know:

* Which order is created by `lra-1`
  * If compensated we could set a different order status
* Which articles and also how many of them were reserved by `lra-1`
  * If compensated we could revert the stock deduction

For this to achieve a simple approach could be:

* Store `lra-1` which was used to create the order in the `ShopOrder` entity.
* Track the `ArticleOrder` with the associated `lra-1` in the `stock` microservice as a new table/entity `articlestockchange`
{{% /details %}}
  

## Database Changes

This leads to the following changes in our database schema for the `order` microservice.

```xml
<changeSet author="lra" id="2">
  <comment>Add LRA field to store associated lra-id</comment>
  <addColumn tableName="shoporder">
    <column name="lra" type="varchar(255)" />
  </addColumn>
</changeSet>
```

On the `stock` microservice we will add the following migration to create a new table `articlestockchange`.
```xml
<createTable tableName="articlestockchange">
  <column name="id" type="bigint">
    <constraints primaryKey="true" nullable="false"/>
  </column>
  <column name="article_id" type="bigint">
    <constraints nullable="false" foreignKeyName="articlestockchange_article_fk" referencedColumnNames="id"/>
  </column>
  <column name="count" type="int"/>
  <column name="lra" type="varchar(255)"/>
</createTable>
```


## LRA Coordinator

The LRA management will be made by an LRA coordinator. The Narayana Transaction Manager[^1], which is the default JTA
Transaction manager in Quarkus and Wildfly application servers, provides an implementation of an LRA Coordinator.

We will use this coordinator for our environment. Therefore, the following changes are made in the `docker/docker-compose.yaml`:

Add LRA Coordinator
```yaml
  lra-coordinator:
    image: docker.io/jbosstm/lra-coordinator:5.10.6.Final
    hostname: lra-coordinator
    container_name: rest-lra-coordinator
    volumes:
      - lra-data:/opt/jboss
    networks:
      - rest
    environment:
      - AB_JOLOKIA_OFF="true"
      - THORNTAIL_LOGGING_ROOT-LOGGER.LEVEL=DEBUG
    ports:
      - 8090:8080
```

The used LRA library `narayana-lra` reads the LRA host and LRA port from system properties.

{{% alert title="Bridged Docker Network" color="primary" %}}
Further the library used the base url extracted form the request-uri to register itself at the LRA Coordinator. Since our
lab runs in a bridged docker network we trigger requests through the mapped port of the docker host instead of the
container name inside the docker network. This is why the `order` microservice would register itself as `localhost` if
we call the `order` microservice with `http://localhost:8080/shop-orders`. We rewrite incoming requests to
`http://order:8080` instead of `http://localhost:8080`. The registering at the LRA coordinator is therefore made
correctly with `order` instead of `localhost`
{{% /alert %}}

To fix the docker network issue, and specify the needed system variables we add the following to the `order` container specification:
```yaml
  order:
    # ... omitted
    environment:
      - JAVA_TOOL_OPTIONS=-Dlra.http.host=lra-coordinator -Dlra.http.port=8080
      - APPLICATION_REWRITE_BASE_ENABLED=true
      - APPLICATION_REWRITE_BASE_HOST=order
```
