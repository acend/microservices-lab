  Building the docker image for the debezium-order microservice and start the environment.
---

In the previous section we implemented the microservice. Let's build and run it.


## Building

The `debezium-order` microservice provides a multistage `Dockerfile.multistage.jvm` for building the java application and creating a docker container.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Build docker container

{{% alert color="primary" title="Docker Version" %}}
Depending on your docker version you have to specify the output format. If you get a warning that there is no output specified for docker-container driver just add `-o type=docker` to your command line.
{{% /alert %}}

Change to base directory of this lab `<PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}debezium` and run docker build.

```s
docker build -f debezium-order/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage.jvm -t {{% param "image_prefix" %}}debezium-order:latest debezium-order
```


## Running


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Starting with Docker Compose

Enter a shell and change your directory to the `<PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}debezium/docker` folder.

If you have any previous lab running stop these containers
```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```

Start the microservices with

```s
docker-compose up -d
