  Run the Lab with Docker Compose
---

We have finished our work on the environment and our `order` microservice. We are now ready to start the environment and setup our debezium connectors.


## Running

If you have any previous lab running stop these containers
```bash
docker-compose down --remove-orphans
```


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Starting with Docker Compose

Enter a shell and change your directory to the `<PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}debezium/docker` folder.

```bash
cd <PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}debezium/docker
```

Start the microservices with
```bash
$ docker-compose up -d
Starting debezium-zookeeper    ... done
Starting debezium-order-db     ... done
Starting debezium-grafana      ... done
Starting debezium-prometheus   ... done
Starting debezium-alertmanager ... done
Starting debezium-jaeger       ... done
Starting debezium-stock-db     ... done
Starting debezium-order        ... done
Starting debezium-stock        ... done
Starting debezium-kafka        ... done
Starting debezium-connect      ... done
Starting debezium-viewer       ... done
```


## Debezium Connectors

With starting the environment we have also started Kafka Connect. We need to configure our Debezium PostgreSQL Connector to listen for events on the `order-db` and `stock-db` database.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Configuring Debezium Connectors

Configuring the Debezium PostgreSQL Connector for the `order-db` database.
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8083/connectors \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name": "order-events",
    "config": {
      "connector.class" : "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
      "tasks.max" : "1",
      "database.hostname" : "order-db",
      "database.port" : "5432",
      "database.user" : "admin",
      "database.password" : "1234",
      "database.dbname" : "admin",
      "database.server.name" : "order-db",
      "schema.include.list" : "public",
      "table.include.list" : "public.outboxevent",
      "tombstones.on.delete" : "false",
      "transforms" : "outbox,topiccase",
      "transforms.outbox.type" : "io.debezium.transforms.outbox.EventRouter",
      "transforms.outbox.route.by.field" : "type",
      "transforms.outbox.route.topic.replacement" : "order-${routedByValue}-events",
      "transforms.outbox.table.field.event.timestamp" : "timestamp",
      "transforms.outbox.table.fields.additional.placement" : "type:header:eventType",
      "transforms.topiccase.type" : "ch.puzzle.mm.debezium.connect.smt.ChangeTopicCase",
      "transforms.topiccase.toCase" : "lower"
    }
}'
```

Configuring the Debezium PostgreSQL Connector for the `stock-db` database.
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8083/connectors \
  --header 'Accept: application/json' \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "name": "stock-events",
    "config": {
      "connector.class" : "io.debezium.connector.postgresql.PostgresConnector",
      "tasks.max" : "1",
      "database.hostname" : "stock-db",
      "database.port" : "5432",
      "database.user" : "admin",
      "database.password" : "1234",
      "database.dbname" : "admin",
      "database.server.name" : "stock-db",
      "schema.include.list" : "public",
      "table.include.list" : "public.outboxevent",
      "tombstones.on.delete" : "false",
      "transforms" : "outbox,topiccase",
      "transforms.outbox.type" : "io.debezium.transforms.outbox.EventRouter",
      "transforms.outbox.route.by.field" : "type",
      "transforms.outbox.route.topic.replacement" : "stock-${routedByValue}-events",
      "transforms.outbox.table.field.event.timestamp" : "timestamp",
      "transforms.outbox.table.fields.additional.placement" : "type:header:eventType",
      "transforms.topiccase.type" : "ch.puzzle.mm.debezium.connect.smt.ChangeTopicCase",
      "transforms.topiccase.toCase" : "lower"
    }
}'
```

As you can see in the configuration of the connectors we specify our connection information and our tables with the `table.include.list` and our `transforms`. We use the `EventRouter` transformation which handles our `outboxevent` table.

Check if the containers are created
```
curl --request GET \
  --url http://127.0.0.1:8083/connectors \
  --header 'Accept: application/json'

[
  "order-events",
  "stock-events"
]
```


## Sample Requests

In the source folder `<PROJECT_ROOT>{{% param "lab_code_basedir" %}}rest/requests` there is an IntelliJ compatible
HTTP Request file. You may run requests directly from IntelliJ or use it as reference for your requests.


Get article stock information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8081/article-stocks
```

Get order information
```bash
curl --request GET --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders
```

Create new order
```
curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
    "articleOrders" : [
        {
            "articleId" : 1,
            "amount" : 1
        }
    ]
}'
```


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3 - Using the application

We provide a `requests/api.http` file containing all requests needed for this lab. This file is compatible with IntelliJ IDEA and also includes the `curl` version for the requests.

There is a [Viewer Microservice](http://localhost:8082) running which provides an overview of events in the Kafka Topics. It uses websockets and shows newly arriving events.

Feel free to test the following scenarios:

* Order Article 1 with quantity 9 (e.g. orderId: 100000)
* Order Article 1 with quantity 3

What do you expect? Was the second order rejected?

What happens if you proceed like this?

* Cancel OrderId 100000
* Order Article 1 with quantity 3

What do you expect? Was the second order rejected?

What happens if you proceed like this?

* Delete the connectors (order-events and stock-events)
* Order Article 1 with quantity 3
* Order Article 1 with quantity 3
* Order Article 1 with quantity 3
* Recreate the connectors (order-events and stock-events)

Were there any errors when the connectors were down? Do the microservices catch up after recreating?

What does the [Jaeger Tracing](http://localhost:16686/search) show?
