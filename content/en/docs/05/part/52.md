{{% alert title="Environment Setup" color="warning" %}} With completing this section the environment is configured. However,
in the next few steps we will build the `order` microservice and its container. After this section you will not be able
to start the environment as this container is still missing. You will be able to start it later. {{% /alert %}}


## Changes to the docker-compose file

The setup for this lab is similar as the previous. However, we use Kafka Connect with Debezium PostgreSQL connector to write messages to Kafka.

### Kafka Connect with Debezium

For Kafka Connect a pre-built docker container based on the Kafka Strimzi image will be used.

The following was added to the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

```yaml
  connect:
    image: {{% param "training_docker_repo" %}}/{{% param "image_prefix" %}}debezium-connect:latest
    hostname: connect
    container_name: debezium-connect
    ports:
     - 8083:8083
    networks:
      - debezium
    depends_on:
     - kafka
     - order-db
     - stock-db
     - zookeeper
    command: /opt/kafka/kafka_connect_run.sh
    environment:
     - KAFKA_CONNECT_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9092
     - |
         KAFKA_CONNECT_CONFIGURATION=
         key.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
         value.converter=org.apache.kafka.connect.json.JsonConverter
         key.converter.schemas.enable=false
         value.converter.schemas.enable=false
         group.id=connect-debezium
         offset.storage.topic=connect-debezium-offsets
         config.storage.topic=connect-debezium-configs
         status.storage.topic=connect-debezium-status
         offset.storage.replication.factor=1
         config.storage.replication.factor=1
         status.storage.replication.factor=1
         consumer.interceptor.classes=io.opentracing.contrib.kafka.TracingConsumerInterceptor
         producer.interceptor.classes=io.opentracing.contrib.kafka.TracingProducerInterceptor
     - KAFKA_CONNECT_METRICS_ENABLED=true
     - JAEGER_SERVICE_NAME=debezium-connect
     - JAEGER_AGENT_HOST=jaeger
     - STRIMZI_TRACING=jaeger
```


### Database docker image

The Debezium PostgreSQL Connector needs to access the WAL log. We therefore switch to the `{{% param "debezium_docker_repo" %}}/postgres:13` image maintained by Debezium. This image provides us the configurations and permissions needed to access the WAL log.

The following changes have been made in the `docker-compose.yaml` file:

* `order-db`: changed image to `{{% param "debezium_docker_repo" %}}/postgres:13`
* `stock-db`: changed image to `{{% param "debezium_docker_repo" %}}/postgres:13`
