## Test your microservice

If your microservices are ull up and running, open two tabs in your browser. View the kafka-viewer microservice on [http://localhost:8082](http://localhost:8082) and open up the Jaeger UI on [http://localhost:16686](http://localhost:16686). The kafka-viewer will open up an active connection to your kafka topics and show you messages passing through the topics. In the Jaeger UI you can follow your traces through the system.

Now fire a request against the order API to create a new shop order. Let's do a POST request to our `/shop-orders` endpoint and create a shop order with 2 pieces of article 1 and 3 pieces of article 2.

{{% details title="Request Task Hint" %}}
Create the POST request with curl.
```s

curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "articleOrders": [
    {
      "articleId": 1,
      "amount": 2
    },
    {
      "articleId": 2,
      "amount": 3
    }
  ]
}'

```
{{% /details %}}

Check your browser and see what insights the kafka-viewer and the Jaeger UI give us. You can clearly see where the event was passing through our system in the Jaeger UI. The trace passes from the order microservices' `ShopOrderResource` REST resource to the `shop-order-request` topic on kafka (seen in the kafka viewer) with some content like:

```json
{"articleOrders":[{"amount":2,"articleId":1},{"amount":3,"articleId":2}],"id":100017}
```

Will then be passed to the `shop-order-confirmation` topic to be again confirmed by the order microservice! Our workflow now works.


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.1 - Follow your traces through the code


Can you follow the traced produced and observed in the [Jaeger UI](http://localhost:16686) through your own code?


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.2 - Compensation instead of confirmations


Can you try to get a compensation event to test your compensation workflow as well? Try to provoke an error to make the stock microservice deny the order!

{{% details title="Compensation Hint" %}}
Create the POST request similar to the one before, but let the article amounts go nuts! That way the stock microservice will throw a `ArticleOutOfStockException`.
```s

curl --request POST \
  --url http://localhost:8080/shop-orders \
  --header 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  --data '{
  "articleOrders": [
    {
      "articleId": 1,
      "amount": 20
    },
    {
      "articleId": 2,
      "amount": 30
    }
  ]
}'

```

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.3 - Observability test

Can you identify where the problem was in the previous request by just using our observability stack?

{{% details title="Observability Hint" %}}

Of course you can! Head over to the Jaeger UI and inspect the latest traces. You will directly see a trace with two errors. If you open the trace and inspect the spans you can investigate the error that happened and you will find the wanted `ArticleOutOfStockException`.

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4 - Enhance observability

Your task now is to enhance the observability in your order microservice. We would like to see metrics to see how many messages we produce and consume in the microservice. In order to do this you will add metrics to your microservice to track:

* order_requests_produced
* order_confirmation_consumed
* order_compensation_consumed

*Hint*: In other labs you have already exposed custom metrics. Try to implement your own now!

{{% details title="Observability Hint 2" %}}

You can annotate your existing functions which handle incoming and outgoing messages with your custom metric like this:

```java
    @Counted(name = "kafka_order_requested", absolute = true, description = "number of orders successful", tags = {"application=kafka-order"})
    @Traced
    public void createRequest(ShopOrderDTO shopOrderDTO) {
          ...
        }
    }
```

You can implement the consuming counterpart just the same!

### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.5 - Test your observability

Can you identify with your newly implemented metrics after rebuilding and rerunning your system how many messages were confirmed and compensated after some requests?
