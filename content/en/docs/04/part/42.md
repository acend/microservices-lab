{{% alert title="Environment Setup" color="warning" %}} With completing this section the environment is configured. However,
in the next few steps we will build the `order` microservice and its container. After this section you will not be able
to start the environment as this container is still missing. You will be able to start it later. {{% /alert %}}


## Changes to the docker-compose file

Since we are going to use Apache Kafka as a message broker, there are some changes to our `docker-compose.yaml` file.


### Apache Kafka Broker

To use Apache Kafka the following was added to our `docker-compose.yaml` file:
```yaml

  zookeeper:
    image: quay.io/debezium/zookeeper:2.3
    hostname: zookeeper
    container_name: debezium-zookeeper
    networks:
      - kafka
    ports:
      - 2181:2181
      - 2888:2888
      - 3888:3888

  kafka:
    image: quay.io/acend/microservices-lab-debezium-kafka:latest
    hostname: kafka
    container_name: debezium-kafka
    ports:
      - 9092:9092
    networks:
      - kafka
    depends_on:
      - zookeeper
    environment:
      - ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181

```


### Kafka Viewer

Further a simple kafka-viewer microservice was added to the `docker-compose.yaml`. The kafka-viewer is a small web-UI which displays messages passing through our kafka topics.

```yaml
  viewer:
    image: quay.io/acend/microservices-lab-kafka-viewer:latest
    ports:
      - 8082:8080
    networks:
      - kafka
    depends_on:
      - kafka
    environment:
      - QUARKUS_HTTP_PORT=8080
      - MP_MESSAGING_INCOMING_KAFKAMESSAGES_TOPICS=shop-order-request,shop-order-confirmation,shop-order-compensation
      - MP_MESSAGING_INCOMING_KAFKAMESSAGES_KEY_DESERIALIZER=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
      - MP_MESSAGING_INCOMING_KAFKAMESSAGES_VALUE_DESERIALIZER=org.apache.kafka.common.serialization.StringDeserializer
```


### Microservice Configuration

To ensure your microservices will connect to the Kafka broker an additional property has been added to both microservices. The property `KAFKA_BOOTSTRAP_SERVERS=kafka:9092` in the environment section will ensure that the microservices will connect to our kafka message broker.
