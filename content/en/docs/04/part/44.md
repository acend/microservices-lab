## Build and run


### Task {{% param sectionnumber %}}.4 - Build, start and test your microservices

It's time to test your microservice in action! Create your docker image with the Dockerfile `Dockerfile.multistage.jvm` and tag it as `kafka-order:latest` as defined in the `docker-compose.yaml` and then start up the entire service landscape with `docker-compose up`!


{{% details title="Docker Build Task Hint" %}}
You can build your image with:

```s

docker build -t kafka-order:latest -f order/src/main/docker/Dockerfile.multistage.jvm order/.

```

Start your microservices with:

```s

docker-compose -f kafka/docker-compose.yaml up

```
